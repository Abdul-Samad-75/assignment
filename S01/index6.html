    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The periodic table in a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties</p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> => 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>) and oxygen gas (<i>O<sub>2</sub></i>) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub>O</i>).</p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><strong>Stechiemetry</strong> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub>  indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>Superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p></p> 

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives</p>
